# weatherapp
This app is an experiment with node.js. 
- I'll be pulling down API data from Wunderground 
- Checking the forecast for rain. It'll remind me via email notifications if it's going to rain
- I'll do some simple statistics on forecast accuracy

I'm continually making improvements. Maybe pull from multiple APIs to exploit nodejs' abilities

Using 
- node.js
- express
- node-restful
- node-mysql
- body-parser
